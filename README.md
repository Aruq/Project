# Project
This project was made for the Distributed Computing class. Final Project is made using the MPI library. Helps calculate the perfect pi with the Taylor series formula
# Project title: Calculating PI number
Calculating approximate value of pi number using parallel computing techniques with mpi library.
# Testing environment:
This technology can be effectively implemented using the Visual Studio environment and the C programming language. To ensure the MPI performance, you must enable MPI support in the project property and include the library of the same name via #include <mpi.h>.
